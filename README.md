Shoply is a full-featured eCommerce platform developed using [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/), designed to demonstrate advanced web development skills while providing a practical, scalable, and modern solution for online shopping. The project leverages a powerful tech stack, including [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) for secure payments, [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design, [Django Allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/) for seamless authentication, and custom commands for streamlined data integration.

## Project Overview

Shoply is not just a technical exercise but a fully operational eCommerce site that demonstrates the ability to design, build, and deploy a comprehensive web application. A key feature of the platform is its ability to populate content dynamically using datasets sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) via [Django management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/). This feature reflects real-world scenarios where developers must manage and integrate large-scale data efficiently.

Core features include:

- Dynamic Product Listings: Populated using datasets downloaded and processed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Secure Payment Integration: Powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) for robust and flexible transactions.
- Responsive Design: A sleek, mobile-first interface built with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- User Authentication: Simplified and secure logins using [Django Allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/).
- Interactive Features: Enhanced accessability, interactivity and usability with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

## UX

I built Shoply around datasets that I downloaded and processed through my custom data pipeline, using the insights they provided to shape every aspect of the website. By allowing the data to guide the design, I created a platform thatâ€™s not only clear and responsive but also deeply engaging for users. Features like "Recently Viewed" and "Top Trending" are powered directly by user behavior and sales data, creating a personalized experience that keeps customers coming back. The dynamic admin interface makes managing product listings effortless, while the navigation automatically adjusts to category changes with liquid formatting, ensuring a smooth and intuitive browsing experience. To further enhance the platform's appeal, I incorporated a unique logo, crafted using DALLÂ·E, giving Shoply a fresh, modern identity that stands out.

### Colour Scheme
I first leveraged [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) to generate an original and distinctive no-image found .jpeg that aligned with the modern aesthetic I wanted for the platform. 

![Shoply no_image found jpeg](static/img/no_image.jpeg)

After obtaining the image from [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/), I used [pixlr](https://pixlr.com/express/) (a free photo editing suite) to crop out the siteâ€™s logo and isolate it for integration into the design. 

![Shoply Logo](static/img/shoply_logo.png)

Next, I turned to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), a color palette generator, to select a cohesive color scheme that would complement the logo and enhance the overall aesthetic of the site. After experimenting with various options, chose a color palette that balances cool blues and warm accents to evoke a sense of trust, professionalism, and approachability.

#### Colour Scheme Extraction
![Colour Scheme Extraction](documentation/ux/colour_scheme_extraction.png)
#### Final Colour Scheme
![Final Colour Scheme](documentation/ux/colour_scheme.png)
- Kepple: `#3FB2A5` used for primary text
- Dark Green: `#043A30` used for secondary text
- Honeydew: `#D0EFDF` used for neutral tones
- Black: `#000000` used for dark text
- Gamboge: `#f39c12` used for contrasting accents

I've implemented them as CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
  /* Light Green */
  --primary-color: #3FB2A5;
  /* Dark Green */
  --secondary-color: #043A30;
  /* Off-White / Light Mint */
  --neutral-light: #D0EFDF;
  /* Black */
  --text-dark: #000000;
  /* Orange */
  --accent-color: #f39c12;
}
```

### Typography

- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico) was used for the accent text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the account and basket icons in the navigation.

### Developer Features

**Kaggle Data Pipeline**

This pipeline consists of three programs designed to download, process, and convert Kaggle datasets. The first command handles downloading datasets from Kaggle, the second processes and filters the dataset according to user preferences, and the third converts the processed data into a structured JSON format suitable for Django fixtures.

**`kaggle_api_handler`**

Downloads and organizes datasets from Kaggle by authenticating with the Kaggle API and saving them to a local directory.

 - Dataset URL input: The user provides the last part of the Kaggle dataset URL to specify which dataset to download.
 - Kaggle authentication: Uses credentials stored in environment variables (KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY) for API authentication.
 - Folder creation: Ensures that the necessary directory (data/raw/) exists and creates it if missing.
 - Error handling: Extensive error logging for missing credentials, download failures, and invalid inputs.
 - Progress logging: Provides detailed logs at each step to track the process, from authentication to successful download.

**`dataset_processor`**

Filters and samples a CSV dataset based on user input and saves the processed data to a new CSV file with a timestamp.

 - User inputs: The program prompts the user for the file to process, the header to filter by, elements to sample, and the number of samples per category.
 - Error handling: Handles issues like missing headers, invalid sample sizes, and issues during CSV loading.
 - Data filtering: Filters the dataset based on selected categories or elements from the chosen header column.
 - Data sampling: Allows for both random sampling or taking the first n entries for each element in the dataset.
 - Processed file saving: Saves the processed data to data/processed/ with a timestamped filename to avoid overwriting.

**`csv_to_json_converter`**

Converts a CSV file into a JSON format suitable for Django fixtures, with a replacement timestamp added to the filename for uniqueness.

 - User input: The user provides the path to the processed CSV file that they want to convert into JSON.
 - Timestamp handling: Automatically adds or replaces a timestamp in the filename to ensure the new file name is unique.
 - CSV to JSON conversion: Reads the CSV file, converts it into a structured JSON format suitable for Django models, and saves it to data/json/.
 - Error handling: Catches issues like invalid CSV format and JSON writing errors.
 - Logging: Provides logs for each step, including file processing, conversion, and saving to ensure transparency.

**`Loggers`**

Loggers are a great way for developers to track their projects in real-time. Providing valuable insights into the development process.

```py
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,  # Use version 1 for Django logging configuration
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,  # Keeps the default Django loggers enabled
    'formatters': {
        'verbose': {  # Defines a format for more detailed logging output
        },
        'simple': {  # Simpler format for quick debugging
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'console': {  # Console handler to output logs to the terminal    
        },
        'file': {  # File handler to write logs to a file
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        '': {  # Root logger - captures all logs
        },
        'django': {  # Logger specifically for Django logs
        },
        'django.request': {  # Logger specifically for HTTP request logs
        },
        'shoply': {  # Custom logger you can use in your applications
            'handlers': ['console', 'file'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',  # Set lower for detailed logs when debugging
            'propagate': False,
        },
    },
}
```

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    # ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)
    asin = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    # Product title
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    # Image URL (URL to the product image)
    imgUrl = models.URLField(max_length=200)
    # Product URL (URL to the product page)
    productURL = models.URLField(max_length=200)
    # Rating of the product (e.g., stars out of 5)
    stars = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=2, decimal_places=1, null=True, blank=True, 
        validators=[MinValueValidator(0.0), MaxValueValidator(5.0)]
    )
    # Number of reviews for the product
    reviews = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    # Price of the product
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, blank=False)
    # Whether or not the product is a bestseller
    isBestSeller = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    # Whether the product was bought in the last month
    boughtInLastMonth = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    # Category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.)
    categoryName = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://shoply-93586e37ffa3.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Amazon AWS
This project doesn't require [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), as the dataset pipeline serves pre-hosted image URLs, which can be stored temporarily in a file on Heroku using [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/django.html). This approach eliminates the need for additional hosting. However, as the project scales, the ability to manage larger data sources more efficiently could be considered as a potential future enhancement. To assist with future scaling, I've included a walkthrough.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.
Make sure you're on the **AWS Management Console** page.

#### S3 Bucket

- Search for **S3**.
- Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access**, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
- From **Object Ownership**, make sure to have **ACLs enabled**, and **Bucket owner preferred** selected.
- From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- From the **Bucket Policy** tab, select the **Policy Generator** link, and use the following steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the entire Policy, and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**

		```shell
