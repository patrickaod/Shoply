Shoply is a full-featured eCommerce platform developed using [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/), designed to demonstrate advanced web development skills while providing a practical, scalable, and modern solution for online shopping. The project leverages a powerful tech stack, including [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) for secure payments, [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design, [Django Allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/) for seamless authentication, and custom commands for streamlined data integration.

## Project Overview

Shoply is not just a technical exercise but a fully operational eCommerce site that demonstrates the ability to design, build, and deploy a comprehensive web application. A key feature of the platform is its ability to populate content dynamically using datasets sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) via [Django management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/). This feature reflects real-world scenarios where developers must manage and integrate large-scale data efficiently.

Core features include:

- Dynamic Product Listings: Populated using datasets downloaded and processed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Secure Payment Integration: Powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) for robust and flexible transactions.
- Responsive Design: A sleek, mobile-first interface built with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- User Authentication: Simplified and secure logins using [Django Allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/).
- Interactive Features: Enhanced accessability, interactivity and usability with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

## UX

I built Shoply around datasets that I downloaded and processed through my custom data pipeline, using the insights they provided to shape every aspect of the website. By allowing the data to guide the design, I created a platform thatâ€™s not only clear and responsive but also deeply engaging for users. Features like "Recently Viewed" and "Top Trending" are powered directly by user behavior and sales data, creating a personalized experience that keeps customers coming back. The dynamic admin interface makes managing product listings effortless, while the navigation automatically adjusts to category changes with liquid formatting, ensuring a smooth and intuitive browsing experience. To further enhance the platform's appeal, I incorporated a unique logo, crafted using DALLÂ·E, giving Shoply a fresh, modern identity that stands out.

### Colour Scheme
I first leveraged [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) to generate an original and distinctive no-image found .jpeg that aligned with the modern aesthetic I wanted for the platform. 

![Shoply no_image found jpeg](static/img/no_image.jpeg)

After obtaining the image from [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/), I used [pixlr](https://pixlr.com/express/) (a free photo editing suite) to crop out the siteâ€™s logo and isolate it for integration into the design. 

![Shoply Logo](static/img/shoply_logo.png)

Next, I turned to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), a color palette generator, to select a cohesive color scheme that would complement the logo and enhance the overall aesthetic of the site. After experimenting with various options, chose a color palette that balances cool blues and warm accents to evoke a sense of trust, professionalism, and approachability.

#### Colour Scheme Extraction
![Colour Scheme Extraction](documentation/ux/colour_scheme_extraction.png)
#### Final Colour Scheme
![Final Colour Scheme](documentation/ux/colour_scheme.png)
- Kepple: `#3FB2A5` used for primary text
- Dark Green: `#043A30` used for secondary text
- Honeydew: `#D0EFDF` used for neutral tones
- Black: `#000000` used for dark text
- Gamboge: `#f39c12` used for contrasting accents

I've implemented them as CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
  /* Light Green */
  --primary-color: #3FB2A5;
  /* Dark Green */
  --secondary-color: #043A30;
  /* Off-White / Light Mint */
  --neutral-light: #D0EFDF;
  /* Black */
  --text-dark: #000000;
  /* Orange */
  --accent-color: #f39c12;
}
```

### Typography

- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico) was used for the accent text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the account and basket icons in the navigation.

### Developer Features

**Kaggle Data Pipeline**

This pipeline consists of three programs designed to download, process, and convert Kaggle datasets. The first command handles downloading datasets from Kaggle, the second processes and filters the dataset according to user preferences, and the third converts the processed data into a structured JSON format suitable for Django fixtures.

**`kaggle_api_handler`**

Downloads and organizes datasets from Kaggle by authenticating with the Kaggle API and saving them to a local directory.

 - Dataset URL input: The user provides the last part of the Kaggle dataset URL to specify which dataset to download.
 - Kaggle authentication: Uses credentials stored in environment variables (KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY) for API authentication.
 - Folder creation: Ensures that the necessary directory (data/raw/) exists and creates it if missing.
 - Error handling: Extensive error logging for missing credentials, download failures, and invalid inputs.
 - Progress logging: Provides detailed logs at each step to track the process, from authentication to successful download.

**`dataset_processor`**

Filters and samples a CSV dataset based on user input and saves the processed data to a new CSV file with a timestamp.

 - User inputs: The program prompts the user for the file to process, the header to filter by, elements to sample, and the number of samples per category.
 - Error handling: Handles issues like missing headers, invalid sample sizes, and issues during CSV loading.
 - Data filtering: Filters the dataset based on selected categories or elements from the chosen header column.
 - Data sampling: Allows for both random sampling or taking the first n entries for each element in the dataset.
 - Processed file saving: Saves the processed data to data/processed/ with a timestamped filename to avoid overwriting.

**`csv_to_json_converter`**

Converts a CSV file into a JSON format suitable for Django fixtures, with a replacement timestamp added to the filename for uniqueness.

 - User input: The user provides the path to the processed CSV file that they want to convert into JSON.
 - Timestamp handling: Automatically adds or replaces a timestamp in the filename to ensure the new file name is unique.
 - CSV to JSON conversion: Reads the CSV file, converts it into a structured JSON format suitable for Django models, and saves it to data/json/.
 - Error handling: Catches issues like invalid CSV format and JSON writing errors.
 - Logging: Provides logs for each step, including file processing, conversion, and saving to ensure transparency.

**`Loggers`**

Loggers are a great way for developers to track their projects in real-time. Providing valuable insights into the development process.

```py
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,  # Use version 1 for Django logging configuration
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,  # Keeps the default Django loggers enabled
    'formatters': {
        'verbose': {  # Defines a format for more detailed logging output
        },
        'simple': {  # Simpler format for quick debugging
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'console': {  # Console handler to output logs to the terminal    
        },
        'file': {  # File handler to write logs to a file
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        '': {  # Root logger - captures all logs
        },
        'django': {  # Logger specifically for Django logs
        },
        'django.request': {  # Logger specifically for HTTP request logs
        },
        'shoply': {  # Custom logger you can use in your applications
            'handlers': ['console', 'file'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',  # Set lower for detailed logs when debugging
            'propagate': False,
        },
    },
}
```

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    # ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)
    asin = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    # Product title
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    # Image URL (URL to the product image)
    imgUrl = models.URLField(max_length=200)
    # Product URL (URL to the product page)
    productURL = models.URLField(max_length=200)
    # Rating of the product (e.g., stars out of 5)
    stars = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=2, decimal_places=1, null=True, blank=True, 
        validators=[MinValueValidator(0.0), MaxValueValidator(5.0)]
    )
    # Number of reviews for the product
    reviews = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    # Price of the product
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, blank=False)
    # Whether or not the product is a bestseller
    isBestSeller = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    # Whether the product was bought in the last month
    boughtInLastMonth = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    # Category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, etc.)
    categoryName = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://shoply-93586e37ffa3.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Amazon AWS
This project doesn't require [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), as the dataset pipeline serves pre-hosted image URLs, which can be stored temporarily in a file on Heroku using [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/django.html). This approach eliminates the need for additional hosting. However, as the project scales, the ability to manage larger data sources more efficiently could be considered as a potential future enhancement. To assist with future scaling, I've included a walkthrough.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.
Make sure you're on the **AWS Management Console** page.

#### S3 Bucket

- Search for **S3**.
- Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access**, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
- From **Object Ownership**, make sure to have **ACLs enabled**, and **Bucket owner preferred** selected.
- From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- From the **Bucket Policy** tab, select the **Policy Generator** link, and use the following steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the entire Policy, and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**

		```shell
		{
			"Id": "Policy1234567890",
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
					"Action": [
						"s3:GetObject"
					],
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					"Principal": "*",
				}
			]
		}
		```

	- Before you click "Save", add `/*` to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (like above).
	- Click **Save**.
- From the **Access Control List (ACL)** section, click "Edit" and enable **List** for **Everyone (public access)**, and accept the warning box.
	- If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the **Object Ownership** section above to **ACLs enabled** (mentioned above).

#### IAM

Back on the AWS Services Menu, search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
Once on the IAM page, follow these steps:

- From **User Groups**, click **Create New Group**.
	- Suggested Name: `group-shoply` (group + the project name)
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review policy** page.
- From **User Groups**, select your newly created group, and go to the **Permissions** tab.
- Open the **Add Permissions** dropdown, and click **Attach Policies**.
- Select the policy, then click **Add Permissions** at the bottom when finished.
- From the **JSON** tab, select the **Import Managed Policy** link.
	- Search for **S3**, select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, and then **Import**.
	- You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into "Resources" key on the Policy.

		```shell
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "s3:*",
					"Resource": [
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					]
				}
			]
		}
		```
	
	- Click **Review Policy**.
	- Suggested Name: `policy-shoply` (policy + the project name)
	- Provide a description:
		- "Access to S3 Bucket for shoply static files."
	- Click **Create Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click your "group-shoply".
- Click **Attach Policy**.
- Search for the policy you've just created ("policy-shoply") and select it, then **Attach Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click **Add User**.
	- Suggested Name: `user-shoply` (user + the project name)
- For "Select AWS Access Type", select **Programmatic Access**.
- Select the group to add your new user to: `group-shoply`
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review user** page.
- Click **Create User** once done.
- You should see a button to **Download .csv**, so click it to save a copy on your system.
	- **IMPORTANT**: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!
	- This contains the user's **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**

#### Final AWS Setup

- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click **Upload**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://shoply-93586e37ffa3.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or Shoply
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/patrickaod/Shoply) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/patrickaod/Shoply.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/patrickaod/Shoply)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/patrickaod/Shoply)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

The local version of the project and the live version on Heroku are quite similar, but there are some differences. Locally, images are stored on the server, while on Heroku, they are fetched from pre-hosted URLs and temporarily stored using WhiteNoise. The local environment uses simpler settings, while Heroku uses configurations designed for production. Performance and storage also differ, with Heroku optimized for handling larger amounts of data. Overall, both versions work the same, but future updates on Heroku may focus on improving scalability.
