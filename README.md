Shoply is a full-featured eCommerce platform developed using [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/), designed to demonstrate advanced web development skills while providing a practical, scalable, and modern solution for online shopping. The project leverages a powerful tech stack, including [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) for secure payments, [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design, [Django Allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/) for seamless authentication, and custom commands for streamlined data integration.

## Project Overview

Shoply is not just a technical exercise but a fully operational eCommerce site that demonstrates the ability to design, build, and deploy a comprehensive web application. A key feature of the platform is its ability to populate content dynamically using datasets sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) via [Django management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/). This feature reflects real-world scenarios where developers must manage and integrate large-scale data efficiently.

Core features include:

- Dynamic Product Listings: Populated using datasets downloaded and processed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Secure Payment Integration: Powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) for robust and flexible transactions.
- Responsive Design: A sleek, mobile-first interface built with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- User Authentication: Simplified and secure logins using [Django Allauth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/).
- Interactive Features: Enhanced accessability, interactivity and usability with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
